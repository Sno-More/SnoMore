# User Purpose
Enjoy the snow without the hassle of dealing with the snow. Whether you are unable to shovel or you just looked outside your window and agreed that wasn't going to happen. We have your solution! Our application Sno' More is designed so you can post your job and then a shoveler will come and shovel your snow away! We will send you a text notification to keep you updated throughout the process. 

# Shoveler Purpose
As a shoveler, I want a way to earn money by helping out my community. With this application, you can do just that. We will send you text notifications to keep you updated throughout the process.
